In order to goo back to the home page, we need to use useHistory. The first step is to import it.
[import {useHistory} from 'react-router-dom';] and we end the fetch call with the following code:

    //history.go(-1); Go back to the last page
    history.push('/');

    the minus one goes to the last page. the / redirects to the home page.

    To add the Delete button and eventually Delete blog posts, we have added a handleClick function that delete
    Blog posts by id. Then specify the method which is "DELETE". Then navigate to the homepage using the history push command



    const handleClick = () => {
    fetch('http://localhost:8000/blogs/' + blog.id, {
      method: 'DELETE'
    }).then(() => {
      history.push('/');
    })
  }

  And at the end of the BlogDetails.js component, we added a delete button with an event listener:
  <button onClick={handleClick}>delete</button>

  Once the button is clicked, the [handleClick] function is triggered, and the user gets navigated to the home page.


  As for the 404 PAGE, we have to add a new component called NotFound.js

  import { Link } from "react-router-dom"

const NotFound = () => {
  return (
    <div className="not-found">
      <h2>Sorry</h2>
      <p>That page cannot be found</p>
      <Link to="/">Back to the homepage...</Link>
    </div>
  );
}

export default NotFound;
