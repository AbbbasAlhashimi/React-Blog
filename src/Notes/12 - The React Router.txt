to install the Router package version 5, we should use the following code "npm install react-router-dom@5"

Then we need to go to the App.js and Insert the following import statement:
import {BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch} from 'react-router-dom';

Then we need to create the REACT Router that wraps the content with "Router" Component <Router> </Router>

Then we need to decide where will our page content go when we navigate to different pages:
So, we chose it to go inside the following DIV: <div className="content">

So we inserted the Switch component "<Switch> </Switch>" which will make sure that only ONE Route will show at anytime.

Then we add the Route Component  "<Route>  </Route>" which is responsible for setting the URL route after the home page.
an example to it can be like this:

        <Route path ="/">
                <Home />
        </Route>

        However, when we navigate to the create blog page [/create], the page will not load.
        to resolve this issue, we must add the word "exact" to the home page so React would display the contents of other pages.
         <Route exact path="/">
              <Home />
            </Route>


App.js Script:
-----------------

import Navbar from './Navbar';
import Home from './Home';
import {BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch} from 'react-router-dom';


function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
    <div className="App">
      <Navbar />
      <div className="content">
          <Switch>
              <Route path ="/">
                <Home />
              </Route>
          </Switch>
      </div>
    </div>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
