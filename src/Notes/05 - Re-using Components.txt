In this example, we have declared the array off objects "blogs" where each object with [title, body, and author] is
called "blog"

When the Blog component is called via the following SCRIPT:

<div className="blog-list">
            <h2>{title}</h2>
            {blogs.map( (blog) => (
                <div className="blog-preview" key={blog.id}>
                    <h2>{blog.title}</h2>
                    <p>Written by {blog.author}</p>

                </div>
        ))}

        </div>

        the returned value consist of:
        1) Styled <DIV> with called "blog-list".
        2) the blog title
        3) the blogs map which  is a higher-order function in JavaScript used to iterate over each item in an array.
        4) "Key" which is an identifier for the sequence of items being called by react.
        5) Each "title in each blog object within the "blogs" array.
        6) Each "author in each blog object within the "blogs" array.

        When the BlogList component is called inside Home.js, it gets called twice
        First: <BlogList  blogs={blogs} title = "All Blogs!"/>
        Bloglist component is called by name "Bloglist" with  the title which is a prop being passed to the BlogList component.

        Second: <BlogList  blogs={blogs.filter(blog => blog.author === 'yoshi')} title="Mario's Blogs" />
        Bloglist component is called by name "Bloglist" with a filtered result using an arrow function that specify the
        requested returned value as "blog" object with author name of "yoshi". which can be found in the following blog:
        { title: 'Welcome party!', body: 'lorem ipsum...', author: 'yoshi', id: 2 },



Home SCRIPT
-------------------------
import { useState } from "react";
import BlogList from "./BlogList";

const Home = () => {
  const [blogs, setBlogs] = useState([
    { title: 'My new website', body: 'lorem ipsum...', author: 'mario', id: 1 },
    { title: 'Welcome party!', body: 'lorem ipsum...', author: 'yoshi', id: 2 },
    { title: 'Web dev top tips', body: 'lorem ipsum...', author: 'mario', id: 3 }
  ])
    return (
      <div className="home">
        <BlogList  blogs={blogs} title = "All Blogs!"/>
        <BlogList  blogs={blogs.filter(blog => blog.author === 'yoshi')} title="Mario's Blogs" />
      </div>
    );
  }

  export default Home;


  BlogList.js SCRIPT
  ------------------------
  const BlogList = ({blogs,title}) => {
    return (
        <div className="blog-list">
            <h2>{title}</h2>
            {blogs.map( (blog) => (
                <div className="blog-preview" key={blog.id}>
                    <h2>{blog.title}</h2>
                    <p>Written by {blog.author}</p>

                </div>
        ))}

        </div>
    );
}

export default BlogList;
